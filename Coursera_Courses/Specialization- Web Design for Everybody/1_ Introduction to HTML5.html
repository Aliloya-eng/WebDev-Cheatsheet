		even if you can make the same style for the font in a "p" tag, But they have different meaning for the browser,

	<img src="" title="look at the html file to know how this comment is popping up" alt="empty image just to show how important is the 'alt' tag (look at the comment in the html file)">
	<!--
		1- using "alt" is importing for the accessability of the page (for meaning and for page readers).
			+++ "alt" will appear in searches at search engines. +++
		2- use "title" tag to make a comment pop up when hovering over an element (not just images).
		3- pay attention to the size of the image (how many KB?) big images take a long time to load.

		to diplay an icon from the site fontawsome we first link a file or import a script from the site in the head of our page, then we set the {class} attribute of our "i" tag to the name that is given to the icon on fontawsome.
			+++ for size (xs,md,lg,2x,3x,5x,10x).
			+++ ofcourse we can use them as links too (inside "href" tag) but it is not a good idea for page readers and evenmore it is not considered VALID to use links without displaying text. in this case we can use {aria-label} attribute to tell page readers where this icon links to.
	-->

<br>
	<a href="#H" target="">HI</a>
	<!--
		1- in an "a" tag we can use {id} as an {href} (so the browser will go to the element with the {id} we used)
		   +++ GOOD FOR NAVIGATION IN THE SAME PAGE OR IN THE SAME WEBSITE (go to a spacific element not just a page)
		2- {target} can be '_self' '_blank' '_top' '_parent' ....   this spacifies if the link will open in a new window or tab or in the same tab that we are in.

	<video src="" autoplay loop controls>your browser doesnt support video</video>
	<audio src="" autoplay loop controls buffered="" volume="">your browser doesnt support audio</audio>
	<!--
		1- we can add (#t=5,25) at the end of the {src} this will tell the browser to play the video or audio only from second 5 to second 25. (#t=,30)=start from 0 end at 30. (#t=40) start from 40 to the end.
